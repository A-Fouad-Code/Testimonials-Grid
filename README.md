# Testimonials Grid

### Copyrights

I got this challenge from [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).  

### Process

I started this challenge with a different approach from my previous works. <br>
I watched a video that was recommended to me by someone else in a comment for a previous challenge that I did. <br>
This video is by Kevin Powell [Check it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ohtVzCSHqs&ab_channel=KevinPowell), basically it's about **Mobile First** approach.
<br>
Implementing this was easier than my normal way of design with was **Desktop First**. I also added an extra design for tablets wich isn't included in the design.<br>

### Summary

I'm open for any feedback as I highly appreciate it and always take it into consideration in my future works.<br>
I noticed that I have _white_ space in a couple of ` cols ` If you have a way to fix it please share it with me. <br>
Finally about the design that I added for tablets, share your thoughts with me and tell me if you liked it or if you would've done it in another way.
